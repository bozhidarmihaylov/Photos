Next improvements (TODOs):
1. Add more unit tests
2. Check how look / perform on a device, and if needed:
- add image downloader to download appropriate size thumbnails and crop them to the exact size needed to be presented
- use PINCache to cache the created images
3. Search can go in navigation bar on top of the grid, and search suggestions can be shown as overlay until the search is submitted - then suggestions can hide
4. Refactor grid collection view data source code in a data source object.
5. Persist history in core data
6. Add views to indicate when there are no results
7. Add spinners when loading initial page, and on when on the bottom when loading next page
8. Paging logic can be abstracted
